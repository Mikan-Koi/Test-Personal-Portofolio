      <h1>Full review from other people with me </h1>
      <p>

          Mikan Koi is someone who clearly enjoys coding and puts real effort into learning and building new things. 
      <br>I've seen their projects, and they always try to do something different or add a personal touch.
      <br>They’re not just doing the basics—they really think about how to improve or make things more creative.
      <br> What stands out most is their consistency and how they don’t give up easily when something gets tricky.
      <br> It’s clear they’re passionate, and I’m sure they’ll keep growing even more in the future.
